        <p>
          Hi there! My name is Joe Maalouf and I&apos;m an aspiring web
          developer. I&apos;m new to the world of coding but have fully immersed
          myself in learning HTML and CSS.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Though my skills are still developing, I&apos;m proud of the progress
          I&apos;ve made so far. I built this website to showcase some of my
          work and track my growth as a developer. I&apos;m excited to further
          improve my coding abilities by learning JavaScript, React, and other
          web technologies. I love the constant challenge of problem-solving and
          creation that comes with coding. There&apos;s always some new
          technique or idea to implement. The details matter and small bits of
          progress add up.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Outside of staring at my screen, I enjoy staying active and being out
          in nature whenever I can. If I&apos;m not working on my coding skills,
          you might catch me running, hiking, or &apos;m looking forward to
          seeing where this coding journey takes me next. Whether it&apos;s
          building personal projects, contributing to open source, or working at
          a startup, my passion lies in creating with code. Feel free to get in
          touch!
